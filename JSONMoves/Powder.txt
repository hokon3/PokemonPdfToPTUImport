{"Move1": {"Name": "Powder", "Type": "Bug", "Freq": "Scene x2", "AC": "None", "DType": "Status", "Range": "6, 1 Target, Interrupt, Powder", "Effects": "The target is dusted with a Coat of flammable powder. If it uses a damaging Fire-Type attack, the attack is negated and instead creates a Blast 3 centered on itself as the powder explodes, and the Coat is removed. All targets within the Blast take damage equal to what the user of the Fire-Type attack would roll for the damage of their attack. This damage is Typeless or Fire-Type, whichever would be more effective. The Powder keyword only applies to the initial Coat, not the Blast.", "Contest Effect": "Beauty", "Contest Type": "Sabotage"}}
